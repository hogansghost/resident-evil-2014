# Resident Evil (mobile browser game 2014)

Originally created as an example of more complex games for advertisers during sales pitches, to showcase that Teads could offer more than just static banners with video on mobiles, I pieced this together over the course of a couple of weeks between other projects.

Yes, this is awful and yes, this is full of old junk code commented out but it was still something I was proud of back in the day and I was finishing my tenure at Teads at the time so I never really went back to it.
